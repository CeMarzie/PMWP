## Overview

Mathematical reasoning captures fundamental aspects of human cognitive ability. Although recent advances in LLMs have led to substantial improvements in automated mathematical problem solving, most existing benchmarks remain focused on English. As a result, robust mathematical reasoning remains a challenging and insufficiently explored capability for underrepresented languages including Persian. 

To address this gap, we introduce PMWP, the first dataset of 15K elementary-level Persian math word problems that supports both supervised training and evaluation of reasoning models. By expanding mathematical reasoning resources beyond English, PMWP contributes to the development of multilingual AI systems with stronger reasoning capabilities.
